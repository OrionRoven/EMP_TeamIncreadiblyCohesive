DISCO:
* You don't have to import anything in order to use currentTimeMillis
* The reason that it takes longer to run than to search is because we need to fill the array first which would take more time
* An array size of over 1_000_000_000 would run out of memory
QCC: 
* How can we test an array of over 1_000_000_000
