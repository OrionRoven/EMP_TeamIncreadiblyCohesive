*added BinSearch and LinSearch
*read currentTimeMillis() description in library/resources
*added steps 0-6 of plan.txt

*we tested BinSearch and LinSearch with a dataset if length 100000000
*On average, we found that LinSearch took a significantly longer time in milliseconds to find the target

* David - Refactored test to use 2d arrays
* David - Added methodology section to README
* David - Added multiple trials and average time for each test case
