## Methodology
  * Test the best case, worst case, and regular case for each method
    * The best case for linear search is first element and the best case for binary is the element at median index
    * The worst case for for linear search is the last element and the worst case for binary is if the element is not in the array


## Results
For an array of length 10, our results were inconsistent and there were barely any differences between BinSearch and linSearch.
However, for an array of length 10000000, the difference between the two search methods was much more distinguishable. (BinSearch completed the task in 1 ms as opposed to LinSearch's 8ms)
## Conclusions
For larger sized data sets, binary search is definitely the better option.
