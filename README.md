## Results
For an array of length 10, our results were inconsistent and there were barely any differences between BinSearch and linSearch.
However, for an array of length 10000000, the difference between the two search methods was much more distinguishable. (BinSearch completed the task in 1 ms as opposed to LinSearch's 8ms)
## Conclusions
For larger sized data sets, binary search is definitely the better option.
